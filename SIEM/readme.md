For my SIEM project, I will use open source tools to make one.

NOTE: This is very much a work in progress thing. Tools are not set in stone and may be changed as I progress in this project.

1. Log ingestion
    Tool: Graylog
2. Log analysis
    Tool: Wazuh
3. Backend Storage
    Tool: Wazuh-Indexer
4. Visualization
    Tool: Kibana? If not, Grafana
5. Intelligence Enrichment
    Tool: OpenCTI vs. MISP
6. Case Management
    TheHIVE vs. Cortex
7. Automation
    Shuffle
8. Investigation and response

9. Health Monitoring
